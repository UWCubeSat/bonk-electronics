* Minor
  + Update C8 to .1uF on spaceduino-dummy-experiment
  + Choose smaller connectors for inter-boards
  + Chamfer Edges
  + Larger Boost inductor
  + Consistent capacitor footprint sizes
  + Indicate IDC polarity on silkscreen
  + FET pullups during startup (and maybe boost conv en. pulldown?)
* Medium
  + Move parts away from holes on containment board (.25in diameter)
  + Move connectors inwards to allow for horizontal headers (containment board)
  + Fix boost LED
  + Bulk Capacitors (esp. at boost input)
  + Better grounding on inner board
  + Flip inner board connector
