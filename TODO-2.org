* make sure all 10uF pads are 1206
* Put larger capacitance at boost converter input
* Pulldown resistor on boost enable for startup
* Better indicatio of IDC polarity on silkscreen
* Pullups for containmet FETs (during startup)
* Larger Boost Inductor
* Containment Board Better Grounding
* Flip containment board connector
* Boost converter LED problem
